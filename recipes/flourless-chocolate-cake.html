        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>18 (1 ounce) squares bittersweet chocolate</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). 
                Grease a 10-inch round cake pan; set aside.
            </li>
            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <li>
                Combine sugar, water, and salt in a small saucepan 
                over medium heat. Stir until completely dissolved; 
                set aside.
            </li>
            <!-- Step 3 -->
            <li>
                Melt bittersweet chocolate in a microwave-safe glass 
                or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after 
                each interval, 1 to 3 minutes. Pour chocolate into the 
                bowl of an electric mixer.
            </li>
            <!-- Step 4 -->
            <li>
                Cut butter into pieces; beat butter, one piece at a 
                time, into chocolate until combined. Beat in hot 
                sugar water. Slowly beat in eggs, one at a time.
            </li>
            <!-- Step 5 -->
            <li>
                Pour batter into the prepared cake pan. Have a pan 
                larger than the cake pan ready; put the cake pan in 
                the larger pan and fill the larger pan with boiling 
                water halfway up the sides of the cake pan.
            </li>
            <!-- Step 6 -->
            <li>
                Bake cake in the water bath in the preheated oven 
                for 45 minutes. The center will still look wet. 
                Place cake in the refrigerator until thoroughly 
                chilled, 8 hours to overnight.
            </li>
            <!-- Step 7 -->
            <li>
                To unmold, dip the bottom of the cake pan in hot 
                water for 10 seconds and invert onto a serving plate.
            </li>
            <!-- Step 8 -->
            <li>
                Garnish with fresh berries of your choice and enjoy 
                your delicious flourless chocolate cake!
